# Abyssal Bloom
Takes the walk boost from crystalmaster and further multiples it by 5% on half hp and 15% at 1 hp.

Works with Lemm's strength by multiplying the boost it(Lemm's strength) already gives with the usual values.

# Boon of Hallownest

Scales spale size the same as Shaman Amp does.

Slows down daggers the same way Snail Soul slows down fireballs.

If Vepsa's Vengence is equiped,wraiths will be replaced with bees and not Boon Blasts.
